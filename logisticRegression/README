This is a CUDA kernel which implements the LogisticRegression algorithm.
It can be used stand-alone, or by Spark.  The JNI code to integrate with 
Spark is under the spark subdirectory, and changes to Spark itself to call 
the kernel are located in Spark-MLlib: 
org/apache/spark/mllib/classification/LogisticRegression.scala

To test and verify, perform the following steps:

1) Build this library by typing "make" in this directory.

2) Build spark from the Spark-MLlib repository.  An example command to do this is from the 
Spark-MLlib folder is: 
"./make-distribution.sh -Pyarn -Phadoop-2.6 -Dhadoop.version=2.6.3".  Refer to the
Spark documentation here for more details: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html

3) Set the configuration properties "spark.mllib.LogisticRegression.useGPU=true" and 
"spark.executor.extraLibraryPath=/path/to/CUDA-MLlib/logisticRegression" if you're running on 
a cluster (e.g. --master spark://...).  If you're running in local mode, you need to specify the 
argument "--driver-library-path=/path/to/CUDA-MLlib/logisticRegression" instead of setting 
spark.executor.extraLibraryPath because the driver and executor are co-located in local mode.
Setting "spark.mllib.LogisticRegression.useGPU=false" or not setting it at all will disable the GPU, and run stock 
spark code.

4) Run your program.  An example program that comes with spark and uses logisticRegression is 
"mllib.LBFGSExample".  Here's an example full command to run that program locally: 

spark-submit -v --master local[*] --conf spark.mllib.LogisticRegression.useGPU=true 
--driver-library-path=/path/to/CUDA-MLlib/logisticRegression 
--class org.apache.spark.examples.mllib.LBFGSExample 
/path/to/Spark-MLlib/dist/lib/spark-examples-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT-hadoop2.6.3.jar
